Currently, I am facing the challenges of being a Product Owner to deliver the best possible product to the customer, dealing with project management, people and processes of a development team in a phase of evolution and growth.
</p>

<p align="justify">
As a developer, I have a Full-cycle performance in various systems, which enables me to work dynamically across all stages of a project, from its inception to its delivery, including maintenance and direct client support.

Here is a list of projects in which I have been involved and would like to share:
