I live daily the routine of a Product Owner, dealing with the management of projects, people and processes of a development team in evolution and growth.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In a developer role, I have Full Cycle performance in several systems. I like the dynamism of being able to work in all stages of a project, from its conception beyond its delivery, with maintenance and direct support with the client.
